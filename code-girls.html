    In February 1942, however, the hypercautious German Navy added a fourth rotor to the naval U-boat Enigma machines, increasing the possible combinations by a factor of twenty-six. The Allies called this new four-rotor cipher “Shark,” and initially it proved impenetrable. The Allies lost the ability to read U-boats. The whole system went dark. This crushing turn of events occurred just months after the United States entered the war, and it began an eight-month period of death and destruction and helplessness, a time when ship after ship went down and it felt very much as though the war could swing the wrong way.

    So Rochefort and Edwin Layton, Nimitz’s chief intelligence officer—also trained by Agnes Driscoll—hatched a plan. They instructed the men at the Midway base to radio a message—not coded, just plain English—saying their distillation plant had broken down and that Midway was short on water. The idea was that the Japanese would intercept the bulletin and pass it on. Just as they hoped, a local Japanese unit picked it up and sent its own message saying AF was short of water, and the message got passed along to the fleet. The Americans intercepted it. The trick succeeded. The Americans had confirmed that AF stood for Midway.

    Many were mathematicians, like Driscoll, but unlike her they had enjoyed the benefit of attending institutions like Yale, Princeton, and MIT, which would never have admitted her. They were big men—literally—and several took one look at her and thought: “witch.” Their oral histories, taken years later, obsessively use this one word to describe her. Before her accident, “she was a very strikingly beautiful woman in her early forties,” one of them, Frank Raven, said. “When she came out she looked like a witch in her seventies who could only walk with a cane and with her sister holding her arm.”

    It was a tense atmosphere in the downtown naval code-breaking offices, full of politics and subcurrents. There was a strong caste system: Career naval men distrusted the new, educated reservists; reservists thought they were smarter than careerists; everybody looked down on civilians.

    Aside from her own wits, she had one thing to help her: a quirky feature designed to cope with radio garble. Garbling was a huge problem in radio transmissions, so the Japanese developed clever “garble checks” so the person at the receiving end could do a bit of math to be sure the message had transmitted correctly. It was a sensible enough tactic, except that it also was an insecure one: Many of these checks—and the ghostly patterns they left—helped with breaking the messages.

    Many things the Japanese did with the intention of making the code harder to break made it easier. Sometimes, enemy cryptographers liked to begin a message in the middle. When they did this, they would include a code group that stood for “begin message here” to show where the message started. The women learned the code groups for “begin message here”—there were several—and gained another point of entry.

    But even once planners grasped the difficulty of fighting a two-ocean war using only men, the idea of putting women in uniform remained controversial. “Who will then do the cooking, the washing, the mending, the humble homey tasks to which every woman has devoted herself; who will nurture the children?” thundered one congressman. People worried that military service would imperil women’s femininity and render them unmarriageable. Many believed servicewomen would be, in effect, fully embedded “camp followers,” a euphemism for prostitutes and hangers-on who followed soldiers from post to post.
